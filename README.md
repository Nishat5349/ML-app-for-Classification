# ML-app-for-Classification
The project involves creating a Gradio app for butterfly classification. It utilizes a pre-trained butterfly classification model (model.h5) and class labels stored in a CSV file (classLabel1.csv). Users can upload images of butterflies to the app, and it provides real-time predictions for the butterfly's class label.
